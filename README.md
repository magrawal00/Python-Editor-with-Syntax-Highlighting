# Python-Editor-with-Syntax-Highlighting
This is a basic Python text Editor just to get an understanding of Tkinter Library as well as how Regular Expressions can be implemmented in Python.
In this project Syntax Highlighting is done by detecting the tokens with the help of Regular Expression (also known as Lexical Analysis)..
With this you can even make your own Text Highlighting Editor and even give Grammar to tokens in order to check for semantics.
